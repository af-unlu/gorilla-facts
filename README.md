## Summary : An anonymous, decentralized news provider. anti-censorship, anti-lobbying news source.
- Written in mostly TypeScript.
- Using Near Protocol & Near SDK.

## The Big Picture?
Imagine a news source on Web 3.0, decentralized and controlled by no one. Users can post news with the information link and the reference link(maybe files, documents etc in some P2P file storage networks), later these uncheckted and unverified news would be got verified by some users(choosen trusted users, voted by the community).
This project is just to test the basic concepts.

## Features
- Everybody can post & see the news.
- Only the Owner can verify or deny the news.
- You can filter only verified news between a range.

## What to do next
- There would be two type of users, readers and verifiers/voters.
- A punishment mechanism for fake news.
- A rewarding mechanism for unique and true news.
- More fields about news, about news political leaning etc.
- Each voters would have vote value, if you keep vote for fake news or lobbied news your vote value would go down.
- anti-lobbying mechanism to prevent voter users from keep voting for same leaning news.
