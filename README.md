## Summary : An anonymous, decentralized news provider. anti-censorship, anti-lobbying news source.

## The Big Picture?
Imagine a news source on Web 3.0, decentralized and controlled by no one. Users can post news with the information link and the reference link(maybe files, documents etc in some P2P file storage networks), later these uncheckted and unverified news would be got verified by some users(choosen trusted users, voted by the community).
That was the big picture, maybe in future this project need an vote validation mechanisms, maybe anti-lobbying mechanism etc.
